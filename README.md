# Forest-Fire-Prediction-System
Forest  fires  have  recently  become  one  of  the  most  regular  natural  disasters,  resulting  in  the  devastation  of  thousands  of  hectares  of  forest.  They  endanger  not  only  forest  resources,  but  also  the  entire  ecosystem,  including  fauna  and  plants,  disrupting  biodiversity,  ecosystems,  and  the  ecology  of  a  region.  It  is  packed  with  dried  senescent  leaven  and  dwelling  that  can  burst  into  flames  triggered  by  a  single  spark  in  the  summer  when  there  has  been  no  rain  for  months. Forecasting forest fires is an essential part of forest fire management.  control. It has a big influence on how resources are allocated. 

# Scope of the project
A  unique  forest  fire  prediction  approach  is  created  using  linear  regression,  random  forest  regression,  logistic  regression,  and  MLP  Classifier.  Weather  parameters are used by the algorithm to predict the severity of the fire hazard.  The  technique  is  used  to  painstakingly  evaluate  the  threat  of  a  forest  fire  incident using data from a dataset.

# Objectives and Problem Statement
Our  Project  aims  to  build  a  forest  fire  prediction  system  which  will  predict  whether  your  forest  is  safe  or  not  by  taking  in  consideration  various  climatic  values .
*To create a machine learning model.
-To predict forest fires.
-To create a user interface for predicting forest fires and display an alert message.
