# Forest-Fire-Prediction-System
Forest  fires  have  recently  become  one  of  the  most  regular  natural  disasters,  resulting  in  the  devastation  of  thousands  of  hectares  of  forest.  They  endanger  not  only  forest  resources,  but  also  the  entire  ecosystem,  including  fauna  and  plants,  disrupting  biodiversity,  ecosystems,  and  the  ecology  of  a  region.  It  is  packed  with  dried  senescent  leaven  and  dwelling  that  can  burst  into  flames  triggered  by  a  single  spark  in  the  summer  when  there  has  been  no  rain  for  months. Forecasting forest fires is an essential part of forest fire management.  control. It has a big influence on how resources are allocated. 

# Scope of the project
A  unique  forest  fire  prediction  approach  is  created  using  linear  regression,  random  forest  regression,  logistic  regression,  and  MLP  Classifier.  Weather  parameters are used by the algorithm to predict the severity of the fire hazard.  The  technique  is  used  to  painstakingly  evaluate  the  threat  of  a  forest  fire  incident using data from a dataset.

# Objectives and Problem Statement
Our  Project  aims  to  build  a  forest  fire  prediction  system  which  will  predict  whether  your  forest  is  safe  or  not  by  taking  in  consideration  various  climatic  values .
*To create a machine learning model.
-To predict forest fires.
-To create a user interface for predicting forest fires and display an alert message.

# Conclusion and Future Scope

Although  the  particular  cause  or  spark  for  a  wildfire  occurrence  cannot  always  be  predicted,  wildfire  risk  can  be  anticipated  to  some  extent  by  understanding  how  climate,  geography,  weather,  and  land  cover  influence  fire  behavior  and  the  likelihood of a fire spreading.
Forest  fires  cause  significant  environmental  damage  while  threatening  human  lives.  A  substantial  effort  was  made  in  the  last  two  decades  to  build  automatic  detection  tools  that  could  assist  Fire  Management  Systems  (FMS).  The  three  major  trends  are  the  use  of  satellite  data,  infrared/smoke  scanners  and  local  sensors (e.g.meteorological).
However,  this  work  opens  room  for  the  development  of  automatic  tools  for  fire  management  support.  Since  the  FMS  system  is  widely  used  around  the  world,  further  research  is  need  to  confirm  if  direct  weather  conditions  are  preferable  than accumulated values  as suggested by this study.
